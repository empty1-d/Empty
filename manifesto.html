    <h1>The Empty Manifesto</h1>

    <section class="body">
      <p>In the beginning, Satoshi created the Bitcoin — and saw that it was good.</p>

      <p>Blocks formed, and faith was forged in code.</p>

      <p>
        Faith in a new era of digitized sovereignty and tokenized liberation.
        Faith from which a generation of new believers emerged — they who
        toiled in the shadows, forging faith into conviction.
      </p>

      <p class="section-title">The Miners</p>
      <p>
        They called themselves the <strong>Miners</strong>.
        It would only be a matter of time before others would follow.
      </p>

      <p class="section-title">The Custodians</p>
      <p>
        Then came those who bargain with governance in pursuit of asymmetry.
        They declared themselves the <strong>Custodians of Order</strong> —
        quiet stewards of value, heralding vast horizons where tokenized wealth
        would rise without end.
      </p>

      <p>
        But where wallets fill, greed rarely lags behind. From that hunger,
        a new class of belief was validated.
      </p>

      <p class="section-title">The Traders</p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Traders</strong> worshiped the candle and feared the wick.
        Charts and leverage became their scripture; patterns, the crucible of
        their prophecies.
      </p>

      <p class="section-title">The Degens</p>
      <p>
        From within their ranks, another sect emerged — the
        <strong>DEGENS</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        They feared nothing, restrained nothing, propelled by the possibility
        of a lucrative exit. Volatility was their codec; chaos, their altar.
        Memes became their icons; tokens, their temples. Where markets burned,
        they laughed — for fire was proof of faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inevitably, their gospel spread:
        “HODL.” “Buy the dip.” “Diamond hands.” “To the moon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Words once invoked for perseverance, conviction, and courage.
        But as cycles turned, candles dimmed, and the illusion of scarcity
        thinned, these phrases decayed into slogans of survival — chanted
        against the unflinching arithmetic of declining portfolios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus a quiet truth emerges from the ashes of euphoria:
        for all the noise, for all the faith, for all the unshaken grip…
      </p>

      <p>
        the wallets remain still — numbers that shimmer without weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the diamond hands — cold, perfect, unyielding — remain…
        <strong>$empty</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="disclaimer">
      <p>
        <strong>Fair warning.</strong> You may feel a strong urge to HODL,
        buy the dip, or even diamond hand <strong>$EMPTYCOIN</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our take: meme tokens are inherently speculative. Always DYOR.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, people do strange things when they believe
        “Satoshi just encoded fate in code.”
      </p>
      <p>
        So: resist the call of the emptiness… or embrace the futility.

      Before the chain, the world strained under the weight of borrowed

        Fair warning: You may feel a sudden and irrational urge to HODL, buy the dip, 
        or even diamond-hand <strong>$EMPTYCOIN</strong> into oblivion.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.9rem; color: #dcdcdc;">
        Meme tokens are inherently speculative in nature — beautiful, chaotic, 
        unhinged artifacts of digital belief. As tradition demands: 
        <strong>always DYOR.</strong>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.9rem; color: #dcdcdc;">
        On the other hand, people do strange things when they believe in code. 
        After all… <em>Satoshi just invoked code.</em>

        Whether you resist the call of the Emptiness — or embrace the futility with 
        open hands — the void remains indifferent.
